# Vid2JPG
Convert video frames into top quality JPEGs.

Vid2JPG is a python script I created to easily convert a standard video file, and using ffmpeg, converts every frame in the video into a 3% quality jpeg.

Then, the video is stripped of its audio, and the JPEG sequence is combined with said stripped audio file to create the final video file for the user to 'enjoy'. Made as a gag for a friend.
